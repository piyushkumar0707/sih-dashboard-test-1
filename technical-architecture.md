## Working Principles

### 1. Tourist Registration and Onboarding
```
Tourist Arrival → Digital ID Generation → Profile Creation → Geo-fence Assignment
```

### 2. Real-time Monitoring Workflow
```
GPS Tracking → AI Analysis → Risk Assessment → Alert Generation (if needed)
```

### 3. Incident Management Process
```
Incident Detection → Automated E-FIR Generation → Alert Dispatch → Response Coordination
```

### 4. Data Security Flow
```
Data Collection → Blockchain Logging → Encrypted Storage → Access Control
```
